# AWS ECS Cluster Node Terraform module

The purpose of this module is to create an EC2 instances set that will make up the nodes of an ECS cluster.

## Infrastructure components

### AWS Auto scaling group
  
This terraform script created **One AWS Auto scaling group** used to ensure high availability of the instance group in the cluster
